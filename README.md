# DirectoryCleaner
This was a quick program made to tidy up my desktop.  What this program does is categorize known files on a desktop into folders named their file type.  An example of this would be the following: the file named "C:/Path/To/File/picture.png" would be moved to the path "C:/Users/UserName/Desktop/png".
